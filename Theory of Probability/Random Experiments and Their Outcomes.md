Probability theory is the systematic study of outcomes of a random experiment such as the roll of a die, or a bridge hand dealt from a thoroughly shuffled deck of cards, or the life of an electric bulb, or the minimum and the maximum temperatures in a city on a certain day, etc. The very first step in such a study is to _visualize_ all possible outcomes of the experiment in question, and then to _realize_ that the actual outcome of such an experiment is not predictable in advance. However, from the nature of the experiment, or from our experience with the past results of the experiment (if available), we may be able to assign probabilities to the possible outcomes or sets thereof.

For example, in the roll of a balanced, six-faced die, the possible outcomes are  to each of which we may assign a probability of  (ie, in many repetitions of the trial, we expect each of these outcomes to occur  of the times). From this, we can also conclude the outcome to be an [even number](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/even-number "Learn more about even number from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with probability .

Similarly, the possible outcomes of a bridge hand dealt from a standard deck are all the  combinations of 13 cards from a 52-card deck, each carrying a probability of .

The possible outcomes of the life of an electric bulb (in hours) is the set  and the possible outcomes of the minimum and maximum temperatures in Philadelphia on a certain day in future (in °C) is . In these last two examples, the sets of possible outcomes may seem to be unrealistically large, but this is because we cannot put an upper limit to the life of an electric bulb, or lower and upper limits to the temperatures in a city. However, from the past performance of many electric bulbs of a certain make, or from the meteorological records over many years in the past, we may be able to assign probabilities to various outcomes in these two examples. Such probabilities are empirical in nature.
